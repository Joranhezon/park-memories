# Points Management

This is an estimation, so it should never be taken as a promise. We should always be aiming to get a more accuracte point estimation, but delivering points is different from delivering value. It's ok to eventually get it wrong and then improve upon it. Communication is also key, so flagging that the estimation is off is also important.

## 0 point
Something easy, simple and small. Should take only an hour to finish.

## 1 point
Still easy and small, but not as simple and small as the previous. Should take half a work day maximum.

## 2 points
Should take a full work day.

## 3 points
Something between 1 and 3 work days.

## 5 points
At this point, itâ€™s probably getting too big. You should check if this task if breakable in other smaller tasks. Should take a week, aka 5 work days.

## 8 points
This should never be a thing. If it gets to this point, there is something wrong with how tasks are being created, and they should be smaller.
