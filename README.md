# Park Memories
Park memories is a webapp is to store pictures and videos related to parks, giving them a timeline, location they were taken and some notes. Although there are some other ways to store such data, none of them gave me a timeline and a map for me to see exactly where I took each picture/video. It is also possible to do the reverse, searching a park from your map and then seeing if you've been there, when you've been there and what memories you made there.

This app also works as my own personal breakable toy, so anything I try out will probably be made here(also everything I break).
